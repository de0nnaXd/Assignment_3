# Assignment_3

Used:
bootstrap used


Project Plan:
For this project, I have a general intro page(my splash page which will welcome users to this site).

The next page I have is the public page in which the data will be displayed from the mongodb database.

With this users are able to input their assignments, therefore it works as a notesapp/reminder app.
Whenever a student checks the site they are able to see which assignments are on their to do list.

There will be a general nav bar to navigate through these two pages and a footer of course.
In my past assignments I struggled with the layout of my site and I was unable to properly connect everything, so I want to ensure that my site is functioning well.

The database will ask for the name of the assignment, the date its due and the description of what it is.

CRUD will have the ability to allow a user to create/read/update/delete their assignments added.
